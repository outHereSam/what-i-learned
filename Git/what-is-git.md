# What is Git?

Git is a version control/source control system. It lets you manage changes to files over time.
With git, you basically have a _time machine_. You can work with different versions of a project at different points in time or check points. These check points ie. **commits** allow you to access the different saved points of a project.
There is also a concept similar to multiverse, which in git is known as **branches**. Branches as the name suggest allow you to branch out of the main timeline into alternate timelines or versions of your project.
You can synchronize branches through a process called **merging**.
